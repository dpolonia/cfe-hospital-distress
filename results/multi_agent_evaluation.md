## Consensus Improvements

1. Integrate more diverse international literature examples of vertical integration for a broader perspective.
2. Deepen the interpretation of results and explore their broader implications for healthcare policy.
3. Include explicit discussion on AI tools used in data processing or literature review.
4. Expand the theoretical framework by more deeply exploring the potential tradeoffs between the proposed mechanisms (e.g., coordination benefits vs. moral hazard) and how they may manifest in the ULS context.
5. Consider conducting supplementary analyses, such as event studies or synthetic control methods, to further strengthen the causal inference.
6. Explore potential heterogeneous effects, such as by entity size or pre-reform financial condition, to provide more nuanced insights.
